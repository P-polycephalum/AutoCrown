Automatic crown segmentation of trees from aerial RGB photos.
I will be starting with 3 tif images from the 50 ha plot in BCI from the beggining of 2022
All aerial images will be saved in aerial_imagery, sub-folder site 

How to build an AI based on crown imagery?
    #numpy to work with arrays, AI learning shows a neural network to predict binary 0,1 with simund distribution
